## 1. Introduction
[![IMDB](https://i0.wp.com/zipporahcardozo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MV5BODc4MTA3NjkzNl5BMl5BcG5nXkFtZTgwMDg0MzQ2OTE@._V1_.png?resize=300%2C300 "IMDB")](https://i0.wp.com/zipporahcardozo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MV5BODc4MTA3NjkzNl5BMl5BcG5nXkFtZTgwMDg0MzQ2OTE@._V1_.png?resize=300%2C300 "IMDB")
When it comes to movies, I feel it has become the most loved form of entertainment. Current growing rate of movies being launched and kind of revenue being generated is increasing day by day.

There are various agencies which provide ratings to movies. This way people find out whether a movie is good enough to watch, how much revenue its making and many more.

IMDb registered users can cast a vote (from 1 to 10) on every released title in the database. Individual votes are then aggregated and summarized as a single IMDb rating, visible on the title's main page. By "released title" we mean that the movie (or TV show) must have been shown publicly at least once (including festival screening).

Users can update their votes as often as they'd like, but any new vote on the same title will overwrite the previous one, so it is one vote per title per user.

IMDb title pages also include a Metacritic Score for a title, as well as user reviews and links to professional critic reviews from newspapers, magazines and other publications. They aim to offer a variety of opinions on a title so users can make informed viewing decisions. We also always display the breakdown of the ratings so users can see the distribution of votes and determine how uniform or polarized the opinion of a movie is.

## 2. Problem Statement:
[![Movie](https://webstockreview.net/images/cinema-clipart-cartoon-19.png "Movie")](https://webstockreview.net/images/cinema-clipart-cartoon-19.png "Movie")
- In last few years, the film industry has become more popular than ever.

- In 2018, movies made total income around $ 41.7 billion throughout the world. But what movies make the most money at the box office?

- How much does a director matter?

- What is the Genre that makes more revenue?

- which year had seen more number of films and revenue?

- Example Scenario:

	- Higher number of movies either on OTT platforms or at theaters is a proof that demand is growing at higher rate and at the same time a good review about movie not only saves our time but also prevents us from watching low rated movies.
	- These ratings at one place serve us good quality movies and on other hand generate more revenue by funneling viewers to them.
